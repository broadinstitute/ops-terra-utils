Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.
