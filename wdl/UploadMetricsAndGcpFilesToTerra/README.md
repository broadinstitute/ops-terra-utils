# WDL Input Overview
This workflow will copy metadata and files from a tsv into a Terra workspace. All GCP files linked from the sheet will be copied to the workspace bucket and entries from the TSV that contained a link to a file path will be updated to point to the new file locations.

## Prerequisites
* Make sure that your proxy service account has access to the source files in the tsv

## Outputs Table:
This script does not generate any outputs directly. However, logs will be provided to track the progress of the file ingestion and metadata transfer. These logs will include details on ingestion status, any errors encountered, and retries if necessary. You can review the logs in the stderr file for detailed information.
