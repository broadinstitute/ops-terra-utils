# Staging Terra Workspace

This is a **staging Terra workspace** designed for the creation of production TDR datasets. You can import and use **WDLs** and **notebooks** in this workspace to facilitate and streamline the ingestion process.

The staging environment allows you to prepare, test, and verify data before migrating to a production environment, ensuring smooth and reliable data management.

Please make sure to use this space effectively to set up and validate all components required for the final dataset creation.
